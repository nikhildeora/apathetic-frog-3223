            <Text>There are many great bodyweight exercises available when either traveling or if you can't make it the gym. Bodyweight exercises like pull-ups, squats and lunges are all beneficial. One of the best upper body exercises on that list is a push-up.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">Why are Push-ups so Good?</Heading>
            <Text>The push-up is an extremely versatile upper body, multi-joint movement that can be done basically anywhere and at anytime. The exercise mimics a chest press exercise but without the weight while using only 64 percent of your bodyweight. To make the exercise more challenging over time, try the following push-up variations when it's appropriate for your body.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Wide Hand Push-Up</Heading>
            <Text>Change the width of your hand placement as you get more comfortable doing the basic version of the exercise. Try a wider hand placement before attempting any type of narrow position. As a result, it will stress more of the outer chest and anterior aspect of the shoulder.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Single-Leg Push-Up</Heading>
            <Text>Simply raise one foot a few inches off the floor when performing the exercise. Keep the raised leg straight, hips level at all times, and the core engaged.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Close Hand Push-Up</Heading>
            <Text>As the name implies, perform the movement with your hands close together. The change of hand placement will stress more triceps.</Text>

            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Push-Up to Side Plank</Heading>
            <Text>This is a personal favorite. You get all the benefits of the exercise, in addition to some core and shoulder stabilization, for the effort. The one-arm push-up, an advanced exercise, is not on our list but if it were, it would be listed at number ten in terms of difficulty alone.</Text>

            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Bench Push-Up</Heading>
            <Text>Elevating the feet during a push-up increases that 64 percent number mentioned above. Make sure you keep the body stiff and straight as a wooden board. Do not let the low back relax during the movement.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Drop Push-Up</Heading>
            <Text>Watch out for this one, going deep, in terms of range of motion may place too much stress on your shoulder. Keep it slow and controlled.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Incline Push-Up Depth Jump</Heading>

            <Text>This is an advanced exercise variation that can very challenging for many. Do not relax the low back while executing the movement.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Plyo Push-Up</Heading>
            <Text>Another great variation which takes a standard push-up to the next level. As you will see, you will not need to do many repetitions with this and the clap push-up.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Clap Push-Up</Heading>
            <Text>Want to overload the chest? This is your exercise. It can also be paired with another chest exercise as part of a superset.

                You now have nine push-up variations to change things up a bit when basic push-ups start to get old. Remember, the body loves change and some of these exercises might be just the stimulus needed. The nine exercises have also been placed in order in terms of difficulty. Some might argue but I think it's pretty close. Give them a try and let us know if you agree or disagree with our exercise order.</Text>

            <Text>As the holidays get closer, the days are getting shorter and sunlight becomes more scarce. For some people, the winter time is not only a time of celebration but also a time when they may notice changes in their mental health. A case of the winter blues is normal for many people, but can it be avoided? Is it something more than feeling down for a few months? Let's take a look at how exercise can help us to feel our best during the winter and stay on top of our mental health.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">What is Seasonal Affective Disorder?</Heading>
            <Text>Sometimes the winter blues are a simple case of cabin fever. Being cooped up inside isn't fun, but if you live in a place buried in the snow sometimes there's nothing you can do. However, the changing of the seasons has a more profound effect on some people's mental health.

                About 5 percent of the US experiences Seasonal Affective Disorder (or SAD), a form of depression defined by its “seasonality” and happening only during part of the year. While it can happen during the spring and summer, most commonly it will onset during the winter months.

                Seasonal depression is attributed to the lack of sunlight in the shortening winter days, as well as people spending a higher percentage of daylight hours inside. These shorter days can also negatively influence your circadian rhythm, which affects your sleep quality and energy levels.</Text>

            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">Symptoms of SAD</Heading>
               <Text>The symptoms of SAD mimic those of other types of depression, like Major Depressive Disorder, but are defined by their seasonality. These include:

-Loss of interest in activities and hobbies
-Feelings of hopelessness
-Decreased energy levels

Additionally, those struggling with Seasonal Depression in the winter will find that they have trouble oversleeping and might experience appetite changes, particularly a craving for carbohydrates. Summertime seasonal depression conversely will often include a noted lack of appetite, insomnia, and weight loss.</Text>
 
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">Treatment for SAD</Heading>
           <Text>Treatment for SAD can come in multiple forms. Commonly, light therapy is used where patients will spend time sitting in front of a light box that mimics natural sunlight. Additionally, doctors might prescribe anti-depression medication like bupropion for seasonal affective
disorder. As a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (or SSRI), the medication increases levels of serotonin in the brain, a neurotransmitter linked to mood and sleep.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">How Exercise Can Help Seasonal Affective Disorder</Heading>
            <Text>Exercise is also an essential part of managing SAD. There are many benefits to both your physical and mental health from staying active, such as increased blood flow and reduced stress. Many of these benefits are great for staving off those times when you feel blue over the winter.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Promotes Healthy Brain Chemistry</Heading>
            <Text>When you exercise, your brain releases chemicals as a reward. These chemicals include endorphins, which can increase feelings of pleasure, block pain, and lift your mood. Additionally, your body will also produce dopamine (the “reward chemical” in your brain), natural
endocannabinoids, norepinephrine, as well as serotonin. This combination of neurochemicals causes what we call the “runner's high.”

A runner's high can be one of the best mood lifters when struggling with seasonal depression. For those struggling with SAD, it can make a big difference. These chemicals are released with moderate amounts of exercise, and additionally, those who work out have higher
regular levels of serotonin than those who don't. In this way, exercise can be working like an antidepressant medication on its own.
While cardio can be more effective as a mood lifter, these benefits can be found in doing almost any kind of exercise. So if lifting weights is your thing, or you're snowed into your home gym, you can still take advantage of the mood benefits of exercise.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Boosts Your Immune System</Heading>
          <Text>Flu season is no joke; during the winter season, more people seem to be sick with something. Especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking your health seriously is essential. Working out actually helps to boost your immune system in a number of ways.

Studies have shown that those who exercise regularly get sick less often and are also better equipped to fend off illnesses they contract. Regular, moderate-to-vigorous exercise increases the circulation of immune cells, like antibodies and white blood cells, throughout the body. This allows your immune system to detect and fight illnesses earlier. Additionally, the lowered stress levels, improved sleep, and anti-inflammatory benefits of exercise all make it easier for your immune system to work. While it's no replacement for your flu shot, it can certainly make staying healthy over the winter a little easier.</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Improves Your Sleep</Heading>
            <Text>The shorter days and longer nights do your sleep schedule no favors. Your circadian rhythm is the body's internal clock that tells you when it's time to sleep. It uses external factors like sunlight and temperature. Throw a 4 p.m. sunset and daylight savings into the mix, and it's no wonder you can feel yourself waking up on the wrong side of the bed during the winter.

Getting quality sleep is important and can greatly help your mental health. Fortunately, staying active makes getting a good night's sleep easier than ever. Our neurochemical friends can help to promote a better night's sleep, as the dopamine and serotonin released can improve sleep quality. On top of that, feeling tired after a workout isn't a placebo! Vigorous activity can help your “sleep drive” to make you more tired, and improve your sleep quality. So push yourself to get those extra few reps in when you're tired. They can do wonders for your sleep!</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Gets You Outside</Heading>
            <Text>While it may be difficult to want to go outside in below-freezing temperatures to get some exercise, being outside is essential for treating seasonal depression. There are only a few hours of sunlight in the day, so take advantage of them while you can! Sunlight is one of the main ways our bodies produce Vitamin D, an essential nutrient that people with SAD are often deficient in. A jaunt in the cold can also break up your cabin-fever, and perhaps help you feel gratitude for the warmth inside!</Text>
            <Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">The Importance of Exercise</Heading>
            <Text>While these are not the only health benefits of exercise, they are all important for staving off seasonal depression. Combining different kinds of exercise over the winter can help you to reap all the benefits they have to offer. Cardio workouts, like running (or ice skating while it's cold!), are great to do outdoors and get you in the sun. Working in some anaerobic workouts, like weight lifting, are great for your immune system. Both kinds of exercise can help your sleep schedule, as well as healthy brain chemistry.

Some kinds of exercise are better than others, so utilizing a comprehensive workout plan can help you fully fend off the winter blues. Integrating different types of HIIT, aerobic, and anaerobic exercises into your workout will give your body the tools it needs this winter.</Text>

        name : "Do You Need More Daily Protein In Your Diet?",
        image : "https://www.jefit.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fit-man-sitting-down-white-stairs-drinking-from-blue-shaker-1536x1022.jpg",
        description : <Box>
       <Text>Many people, including some researchers, have differing opinions when it comes to the amount of daily protein your body actually needs. The numbers also vary depending on whether you're a strength or an endurance athlete. Additional factors like age and the number of days you're hitting the gym will also play a role in your intake.

Do you need the suggested RDA of 0.8 grams/kg/day or is it more in line with 1-2 gram/kg/day? The answer may depend partly on the volume of work you're doing in daily workouts. Here is what some of the research has shown regarding daily protein intake.</Text>
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">Research Shows a Higher Need for Protein Intake</Heading> 
<Text>Back in the 1970's and 1980's, a few published studies suggested exercise might actually cause significant changes in protein metabolism. One such study done at the USDA HNRC on Aging at Tufts University in 1988. I was actually one of the ”young” research subject for this particular study. The study by Meredith and colleagues looked at the protein needs of six young (26.8 +/- 1.2 yr) and six middle-aged (52.0 +/- 1.9 year) endurance-trained men. All of the subjects consumed either 0.6, 0.9, or 1.2 grams/kg/day of high-quality protein over three separate 10-day periods. All subjects maintained their training and a constant body weight. The results of the study estimated that protein requirement was 0.94 +/- 0.05 grams/kg/day for the 12 men, with no effect of age. The data from this study showed greater daily protein needs than the current Recommended Dietary Allowance of 0.8 g/kg/day.</Text>
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">Additional Research on Daily Protein</Heading> 
<Text>Several studies based on data collected from individuals engaged in vigorous aerobic exercise, on a regular basis, demonstrated higher daily protein needs more in line with 1.1 to 1.4 grams/kg/day. This by the way is about 38%-75% above the current RDA range. Various research groups have reported the optimal intake should be more in line with a protein range of 1.5 to 1.8 grams/kg/day; about 88% to 125% above the RDA.

A research paper published by Roger Fielding and his colleague cited “current recommended intakes of daily protein for strength and endurance athletes are 1.6 to 1.7 g/kg and 1.2 to 1.4 g/kg per day, respectively. They went on to mention that most athletes get enough protein in their diet. Where most typically get things wrong is with “the timing and nutritional content of the post-exercise meal, (is) often overlooked.”</Text>
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">Protein Recommendations</Heading> 
<Text>Current recommended protein intake could actually limit muscle growth. Dietary protein needs according to Lemon and colleagues, for physically active individuals, has been debated for centuries. The RDA guidelines are not going to change any time soon. The evidence supports a higher daily protein intake for individuals involved in strenuous physical activity, such as strength training. More in line with 1.1 to 1.8 grams/kg/day, in order to effectively increase lean muscle tissue. If you are not involved in regular exercise, the RDA of 0.8 grams/kg/day will suffice.</Text>

        image : "https://www.jefit.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/strong-young-man-holding-dumbbells-1536x926.jpg",
        description : <Box>
        <Text>One of the leading back experts in the world is Stuart McGill, PhD. He has spent his career, spanning more than 30-years, researching spinal biomechanics at the University of Waterloo in Canada. His core stability program, known as the Big 3, is one of the most often performed core exercise programs. His routine is so good, we are going to show you what's involved.</Text>
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">What is Core Stability Anyway?</Heading> 
<Text>When the body is inactive, muscle weakness occurs along with joint laxity which can lead to instability according to Dr. McGill. Core stability is the ability of the stabilizers in the lumbar-pelvic area to maintain the correct trunk and hip posture during static and dynamic movement. The stabilizers refer to the following muscle groups that make-up this important area. These are the transverse abdominis, internal and external obliques, and lumbar multifidus. Also playing a critical role are the spinal erectors and rectus abdominis. The key muscle in terms of spine stabilization, however, is the deep transverse abdominis. Why is all this important? Simply stated, if the area is strong, you move better. In essence, when the body has a stable base for the four extremities to perform from, the nervous system allows for greater force development to occur.</Text>
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">What is the McGill Big 3?</Heading> 
<Text>Through his research, Dr. McGill determined the combination of the following three exercises were most beneficial for developing core stability. Understand we're talking muscle endurance here (not strength). The three exercises in his program include the side bridge, a version of the curl-up and a bird dog exercise. Each of the exercises are performed from their basic or beginner level before progressing, over time, to more advanced versions of the exercise. The key to each exercise is locking in with abdominal “bracing” prior to the start of each exercise and maintaining it throughout. Dr. McGill explains that the abdominal brace “enhances stability.” This is done by placing two fingers on both sides of the navel. Your fingers should be a few inches away from the navel, resting on the obliques. Now tighten the abdominal area and you should feel the fingers raise up a bit.</Text>
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Side Bridge</Heading>
<Text>The bridge or called a side plank by some, is a basic core exercise and is ideal for developing endurance in the core stabilizers like the internal and external obliques. It is also a great exercise to help strengthen the quadratus lumborum, an exercise that helps not only with low back pain but is important for pelvic stabilization too. The side bridge pictured above is considered more of a progression from a basic side bridge performed with knees bent and the arm positioned on hip not raised as seen in the picture. Lift hips off the floor and pause for 10-seconds and repeat for desired repetitions.</Text>
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Curl Up</Heading>
<Text>The idea behind this type of curl up is to protect the lumbar spine by keep that area flat. This is done by placing the hands under the lumbar curve. Begin by performing abdominal bracing. Once the scapula clear the floor pause for 10-seconds and return to the starting position. Look up towards the ceiling at all times not down at your feet.</Text>
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="blueincolor littleshort">Bird Dog</Heading>
<Text>This is one exercise you may have done while in yoga class. The starting position for the McGill version is to actually not raise the arm. First, perform abdominal bracing. Begin by just raising the extended leg only. The opposite arm can be raised over time as you advance to the next progression. When this becomes easy to do, bring the extended arm down touching the knee of the opposite leg. Hold arm and leg extension for 10-seconds, return and repeat. Perform on both sides.</Text>
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">How Does Core Stability and Get You Stronger in the Gym?</Heading> 
<Text>The easiest way to start thinking about all this is in the vein of “transferring” power throughout the body when training. An underdeveloped or weak core will create a “leak” or an escape of stored energy via the trunk during exercise. We want to utilize 100 percent of this stored energy. An example would be lifting a barbell, dumbbell, medicine ball or kettlebell off the floor and pressing it overhead. When the core stabilizers are not up to par, and abdominal bracing is not utilized, these types of movements become extremely difficult to perform. Further, even if somehow you're able to perform such an exercise, lacking core integrity, you'll likely end up using poor body mechanics and a future injury is likely. Stay Strong and try the Big 3 as either a new core routine or as a warm-up prior to strength training.</Text>

         <Text>If you want to lose body fat, you're not alone. Effective fat loss, however, can be very challenging at times, especially if you try to overcomplicate things. Many magazines, articles, Instagram “experts” and YouTubers like to share their opinions on the matter, and this can make it seem even more complicated. Below, you'll find four simple items that you need to remember for effective fat loss. Stick to them, and it'll work for you too.</Text>
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">Find Types of Exercise You Enjoy Doing</Heading>
<Text>Exercise is important but not the most crucial aspect of fat loss, believe it or not. It can help, though, and a ton of additional benefits come with doing it. Finding a type of exercise you enjoy doing is key. Why? Because you'll do it more often. Add some high intensity intervals into your cardio mix. Switch it up occasionally with longer duration exercises like a long bike run or jog and just have fun with it. Let's look at four other important tips for fat loss.</Text>  
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">Increase Your NEAT </Heading>  
<Text>Non-exercise activity thermogenesis, or NEAT, is the energy your body uses for daily movement other than exercise. Len Kravitz, PhD, defines NEAT as “the energy expenditure of daily activities such as sitting, standing, walking, and talking - all activities that are not considered planned physical activity of a person's daily life.” It is basically the “micro” exercise you do each day while going about your daily activities. By walking more and aiming to be more active day to day, it will, collectively, make a big difference.

In one research study it was determined that lean subjects (higher NEAT level) expend approximately 350 more calories a day (i.e. walking and standing) when compared to obese subjects (lower NEAT level). That amount of calories over the course of one year (with all other factors being equal) would equate to a weight-loss of 36.5 pounds!</Text>
<Heading fontWeight={"normal"} fontSize={["26px", "28px", "30px"]} className="littleshort">Improve Sleep and Stress </Heading>  
<Text>Sleep and stress play a huge role in fat loss. Make sure you're getting a minimum of 8 hours a night, and keep your stress levels under control.
